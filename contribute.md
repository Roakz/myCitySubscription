## This Will Be A Planned Project

Please provide your thoughts and feedback and contribute as you feel fit. However this project does have a overall goal, so please don't be offended if a pull request gets rejected or you are asked for further information, code formatting or fixes, or just plain told its not viable for the product.

There will be wireframes and mockups for basic layout ideas etc, so please be respectful of the overall goals of the planners.

You are welcome and encouraged to provide feedback and ideas to improve myCitySubscription, so go ahead and make a pull request with your improvements! Just don't be hatin' :P

## Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). I actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- Pull before pushing to ensure the latest updates are in your pull request.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Issue that pull request!
- Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
    - In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using Github's Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; It's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
This is an example of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's another example from Craig Hockenberry, an app developer whom I greatly respect.

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Lets try and maintain a consistent style throughout so as not to end up with an extremely messy monolith that no one wants to deal with! ðŸ˜„
